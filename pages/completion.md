# Complete the flash fictio

I froze where I stood, the chill in the air deepening. The room—the old study at the end of the hallway—had always given me a bad feeling, but tonight something felt worse.  With the door open behind me, letting light spill across the dusty carpet, I tried to focus on the “strange figure.” It looked human, but not quite: its features blurred in the gloom, and it stood too straight, too still—like a mannequin pressed into a suit two sizes too large.

“Smile,” it repeated, though its mouth never moved. Somehow, I felt the sound in my own head instead of hearing it from across the room.

My eyes flicked to the corners: no cameras, at least none I could see. But then the figure lifted a narrow hand and pointed—first at me, then at the cracked mirror on the wall. As I watched, my reflection began to warp, my face stretching into a caricature of a smile, wider and wider until it hurt just to look.

“Say cheese,” the figure breathed, and the world flashed a brilliant, searing white.

This opening line creates an immediate sense of unease and intrigue. It suggests someone has been watching the protagonist without their knowledge, and the description of a "strange figure in the corner" adds an ominous tone. The line works well as an opening for a thriller, horror story, or suspense narrative, as it:

1. Establishes tension right away
2. Creates questions in the reader's mind (Who is this figure? Why are they watching? How did they get there?)
3. Implies surveillance and possibly threatening intentions
4. Sets up a power imbalance between the watcher and the watched

Would you like me to suggest ways to develop this into a longer narrative, or would you prefer to continue the story yourself?

This simple sentence can spin off in so many directions! Here are a few ways the story could continue, depending on the desired tone:

**Option 1 (Suspense/Horror):**
> My blood ran cold. The voice was a dry, papery rasp, seeming to emanate from the deepest shadows in the corner, where the evening light couldn't quite reach. I couldn't make out features, only a silhouette that seemed too tall, too thin. "Camera?" I managed, my own voice a choked whisper. "Who... who are you?"
> The figure shifted, a barely perceptible movement. "Doesn't matter who I am. It matters who *you* are. And what you're about to do. Smile now. It’s for posterity." A faint, almost inaudible whirring sound started up, like an old film projector.

**Option 2 (Sci-Fi/Uncanny):**
> I blinked, trying to focus. The figure wasn't human, not quite. It was composed of shifting, geometric shapes that somehow coalesced into a vaguely humanoid form, its voice a synthesized, multi-tonal hum. "Camera?" I asked, stepping back. "What kind of camera? And why are you in my apartment?"
> "Observation protocol 7.3," it stated, a small, almost invisible lens glinting from what I presumed was its head. "Your species is... photogenic under duress. Please, a natural expression of terrified compliance would be optimal for the archives."

**Option 3 (Dark Humor/Absurd):**
> I squinted. "Excuse me? First, rude to just appear in someone's room. Second, if this is for some candid prank show, my agent will be hearing about this."
> The figure, draped in what looked suspiciously like a moth-eaten velvet curtain, gestured vaguely with a skeletal hand. "Oh, nothing so gauche, my dear. This is far more... niche. A little something for my private collection. 'Mortals Reacting to Impending, Unspecified Weirdness.' Now, that smile? Or perhaps a little scream? Both work wonderfully."

**Option 4 (Psychological Thriller):**
> My heart hammered against my ribs. I knew that voice, but from where? I scanned the corner, but the dim light made it hard to discern features. Was it a hallucination? A dream? "This isn't funny," I said, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice.
> "Funny?" The figure chuckled, a low, unsettling sound. "Oh, I suppose it has its moments. But this isn't about humor. It's about truth. Your truth. And we all get to see it. Smile. Let them see you." I felt a prickle on my skin, the undeniable sensation of being watched by more than just this one presence.

**Which direction feels most compelling to you?**

"Smile, you're on camera," said the strange figure in the corner of the room.
